## RULES
-----------------
### Commit messages
Commit naming rule are the same as for issues, but you need to add the number of the issue in the end of the commit message.

### Pattern
>`[AREA]:[WHAT_IN_THE_COMMIT] (#[NUMBER_OF_ISSUE])`

### Example
>`OPS: finalize deployers (#41)`

-----------------
### Branches
Branches naming rule are the same as for issues, but you need to add the number of the issue in the start of the branch name.

### Pattern
>`feat/[NUMBER_OF_ISSUE]_[AREA]_[DESCRIPTION_FROM_ISSUE]`

### Example
>`feat/41_ZNAK_add_testnet_deploy_scripts`

-----------------

### Issues
Issues naming rule are the same as for commits.

### Pattern
>`[AREA]:[WHAT_TO_DO_OR_FIX]`

### Example
>`OPS: add testnet deploy scripts to all infrastructure`

## STEPS FOR CONTRIBUTION IN THE EXISTING CODE

<details>
    <summary> 1. UNDERSTAND AREA </summary> Understand in which part of the contracts there is a code that you want to change
        For the IZNAK and BuyerRouer interfaces, you will need to specify <strong>ZNAK</strong>, for <strong>ZNAK</strong> or BuyerRouter contracts, <strong>ZNAK</strong> is also required. For <strong>IETF</strong> interfaces and <strong>ETF</strong>, <strong>ETFRouer</strong> contracts, specify the <strong>ETF</strong>.
        <p>Right now, the issues are divided into 3 parts:</p>

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ZNAK | The RCT token contract and its routers/libs also tests |
| JESTER | The ETF indexes contracts and its routers/DEX/Farms also tests |
| OPS | The deployers, actions and tools |
